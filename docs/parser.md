## 🔍 Here's what's **good** about current parser:

* ✅ Clear recursive descent structure — easy to understand and extend.
* ✅ Supports common constructs: variable declarations, expressions, if statements.
* ✅ Decent error reporting with line and column tracking.
* ✅ Tokenizer and parser are modular.

---

## Things to **improve** before production:

### 1. **No Error Recovery**

* Current error handling stops parsing at the first error (`Result<T, String>`).
* **In production**, you'd want to **recover from errors** (e.g., synchronize to next semicolon or statement) and continue parsing.

**Fix**: Implement error recovery patterns (like panic-mode or phrase-level recovery).

---

### 2. **No Block Scoping or Indentation/Braces**

* The parser assumes `if (...)` has body directly after `(` and `)`, but doesn't account for nested blocks or scoping.
* For real languages, you'd need `{}` blocks or indentation rules (like Python).

---

### 3. **No Type System / Semantic Analysis**

* No type checking, constant folding, or validation of variables.
* You're only building an AST, not checking for undeclared variables, type mismatches, etc.

---

### 4. **No Comments or Whitespace Ignorance in Parser**

* Comments are tokenized, but not ignored in the parser (should be skipped).
* This may cause unexpected parser errors.

---

### 5. **No Extensibility for Larger Grammars**

* Recursive descent is fine, but hard to maintain for large grammars.
* For larger languages, parser generators (like `lalrpop` or `pest` in Rust) may be more scalable.

---

### 6. **No Support for Operator Precedence Table**

* Precedence is hardcoded by nesting functions.
* A production parser might use a **precedence table** or Pratt parser for cleaner operator handling.

---

## ✅ When is it fine to use this in production?

* ✅ CLI tools, DSLs, config parsers, game scripting engines with limited syntax.
* ✅ Tools where you **control the input** and want **fast prototyping**.
* ✅ If you don't mind extending and improving it over time.

---

## 🚀 What to do before production:

* Add unit tests and fuzz tests for both lexer and parser.
* Improve error messages and recovery.
* Add support for code blocks (`{}` or indentation).
* Consider separating parsing stages (token -> AST -> semantic analysis).
* Optionally integrate with a parser combinator or parser generator for scale.
