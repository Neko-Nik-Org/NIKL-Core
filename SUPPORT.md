# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using `NIKL`? Here's how.


## How to get help

Use GitHub issues for **bug reports** and **feature requests**. For general questions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/NIKL-Core/discussions). Or join the [Neko Nik Discord server](https://discord.gg/PYqHVUGdwv) to ask questions in the respective channel. This is the best way to get help with the NIKL project.


## How to ask for help

When asking for help, please follow these guidelines:

1. :book: **Read the documentation and other guides** of NIKL to see if you can figure it out on your own. The documentation is available at [Nik-Lang Documentation](https://nikl.nekonik.com). See if there are any guides or tutorials that can help you.

2. :bulb: **Search for answers and ask questions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/NIKL-Core/discussions)**. This is the best place to ask general questions about Nik-Lang. You can also search for existing discussions to see if your question has already been answered. Or join the [Neko Nik Discord server](https://discord.gg/PYqHVUGdwv) to ask questions in the respective channel. The community is friendly and willing to help, so don't hesitate to ask!

3. :memo: As a **last resort**, you may open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/NIKL-Core/issues) to ask for help. However, please clearly explain what you are trying to do, and list what you have already attempted to solve the problem. Provide code samples, but **do not** attach your entire project for someone else to debug. Review our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/NIKL-Core/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

4. :triangular_ruler: Check the official project board at [NIKL Project Board](https://github.com/users/Neko-Nik/projects/3) to view the roadmap, ongoing work, and all related issues. This is a great place to see what‚Äôs planned, in progress, or recently completed for Nik Lang.


## What NOT to do

Please **do not** do any of the following **unless specifically directed**:

1. \:x: **Do not contact contributors individually** (e.g., via LinkedIn, Twitter, Discord, or email) unless they have explicitly said it's okay. Respect their time and privacy.

2. \:x: **Do not email other contributors** unless it's a [security issue](https://github.com/Neko-Nik/NIKL-Core/blob/main/SECURITY.md).
   üëâ **However, feel free to reach out to *me*** (project owner) via email or social media if you have a question or just want to chat ‚Äî I‚Äôm open to it!

3. \:x: Do not open duplicate issues or clutter existing ones with +1‚Äôs or ‚Äúsame here‚Äù comments. Use reactions or contribute constructively instead.

These guidelines help ensure the community stays respectful and productive. Public questions get public answers, which benefits everyone. ‚úåÔ∏è
